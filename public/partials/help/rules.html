    <h3>Prerequisites</h3>
    <p>An official match is put in motion by issuing a challenge through the ladder system.
        Verbal challenges are great, but to advance on the ladder those words must be put into code!
        See the <a ng-href="#!/help/challenges">Challenges</a> guide for more information on how
        to do this and to report the outcome of the match.</p>

    <h3>Beginning a Match</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>PING to determine who will serve first.</li>
        <li>While not required, please remind your opponent this is a challenge match.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Serving</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Present the ball flat above your palm at table level.</li>
        <li>Toss the ball at least six inches without spinning the ball.</li>
        <li>Strike the ball behind the table edge.</li>
        <li>The ball must bounce once on your side and at least once on the opponent's side.</li>
        <li>If the ball meets the above conditions AND contacts the net, redo the serve.</li>
        <li>While not required, it is good practice to declare the score before serving.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Switching Serves</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Alternate service player every two points.</li>
        <li>When both players have 10+ points a different serving pattern occurs.</li>
        <ul>
            <li>The player who served at 0-0 will always serve when the score is equal.</li>
            <li>The other player will serve at all other times.</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>

    <h3>Winning a Game</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The first player to have 11+ points and be ahead by 2 points is the winner.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Winning the Match</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Best of 5 games when challenging tier 1.</li>
        <li>Best of 3 games when challenging tier 2+.</li>
    </ul>
