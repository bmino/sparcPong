    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>Configure your alert settings to get notifications for important events such as
        being challenged. Alerts help you focus on your daily work and bring
        sparc pong into your focus when relevant.</p>

    <h3>Setting up Alerts</h3>
    <p>Before any alerts will be sent, you must have an email address on file. This email address
        can be a regular run of the mill email address, or the mail server for your wireless
        company. Configuring your email address this way will allow you to receive text message
        alerts on your mobile device. Log in and navigate to the "Account" tab to add an email.
        For example, (843) 123-4567 on a verizon network would be 8431234567@vtext.com</p>

    <h3>Configuring Alerts</h3>
    <p>Now that you have an email address on file, you might not want to receive alerts for
        everything. Log in and navigate to the "Account" tab. Here you can toggle alerts for
        the categories listed. The default is to receive challenge and forfeit alerts.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Challenged</strong> - alerted when someone challenges you</li>
        <li><strong>Revoked</strong> - alerted when someone revokes a challenge against you</li>
        <li><strong>Resolved</strong> - alerted when you are involved in a completed challenge</li>
        <li><strong>Forfeited</strong> - alerted when someone forfeits your issued challenge</li>
    </ul>
